# Health-Care-Website 💉

## Hello There 🙋‍♂️ 

### 🔴 I developed my internship Project for FRT 

#### Project Demo Link 🖇️ : https://yellow-meadow-049856210.1.azurestaticapps.net/
#### Github Repository Link 🖇️ : https://github.com/Bhuwan-Wankhede/Health-Care-Website

#### The Project is Based on Health Industry 

#### Project Title is DOCTOR VIEW 

 ***Opportunities*** : DOCTOR VIEW's is a website where patient can directly visit and can book a appointment of Doctor Directly. Patient can choose his doctor for treatment without listening any advice given by the neighbours and relatives by viewing the honest feedback and videos submit by there patients. Doctor's get a amazing platform to increase there reach from local area to district, state, country level. Using the website will help them to know there patients and can diagnose or suggesting medicine for acute diseases through online meet rather than physically visiting a doctor. this website still in its growing state only front end part is completed.

#### Project Description : Doctor View is a website where patient can directly visit and can book a appointment of Doctor Directly. Patients rather roaming to hundreds of hospital finding right doctor whose prescribed medicines works on patients disease, patients can directly website Doctor view and can find the right doctor through reviews and Feedbacks given by doctor's past patient which will surely make the job easy since doctor view is not 100% ready now. In future addon facilities will be online meets and doctor house visit service in for medication and regular check ups. I make use of static web app service, VS code & Web to deploy the project in resource group through azure cloud. Hope U will Like the project.
